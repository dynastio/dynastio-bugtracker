New issues will be checked by a Dynastio dev and marked reviewed if they are kept. This means that Dynastio devs is aware of the issue and the issue will stay open as long as Dynastio team believes it hasn't been fixed. There won't be further comments on the issue unless there are specific questions or information to convey. In particular it isn't possible to give up-front timeframes for when things will be fixed. There is no need to post on open issues that they have not been fixed as Dynastio team will close issues when they are expected to be fixed.

Make sure you use latest version on dynast.io (if you don't use web client, update it).
Standalone version of the game requires a 64-bit capable CPU and distribution.

Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
